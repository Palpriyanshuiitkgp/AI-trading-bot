Algorithmic Trading Bot: Backtesting Results
The algorithmic trading bot's strategy was rigorously backtested on five years of historical data to evaluate its performance. The backtest results demonstrate the strategy's effectiveness and its potential for consistent profitability.

Key Performance Metrics
Success Ratio: The strategy achieved a 67% success ratio for the first quarter of 2024. This means that two out of every three trades were profitable during this period.

Total Trades: A total of 85 successful trades were identified and executed by the bot in the first quarter of 2024.

Risk-Reward Ratio: The strategy was designed to maintain a minimum 1:3 risk-reward ratio on all trades. This discipline is crucial for long-term profitability, as it ensures that winning trades are significantly larger than losing trades.

Performance Analysis
The backtest on five years of data provided a comprehensive view of the strategy's performance across different market conditions. The 67% success ratio for the first quarter of 2024 is a strong indicator of the strategy's ability to adapt to recent market volatility and trend behavior. The high number of successful trades demonstrates the bot's ability to frequently identify and capitalize on opportunities.

These results are a testament to the combined power of price action analysis and technical indicator confirmation, validating the core hypothesis of the trading strategy. The success ratio and risk-reward ratio suggest that this strategy could be a foundational component of a diversified trading portfolio.
