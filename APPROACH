Algorithmic Trading Bot: Approach and Methodology
This document outlines the detailed strategy and methodology used in the algorithmic trading bot project. The goal was to build a robust, data-driven system capable of identifying high-probability trading opportunities with a favorable risk-reward ratio.

1. Strategy Development
The core of the strategy is the identification of demand and supply zones based on price action. These zones are areas on a price chart where a strong concentration of buy or sell orders has historically caused the price to reverse its direction.

To confirm the validity of a trade signal from these zones, the bot uses a multi-factor approach with the following technical indicators:

Relative Strength Index (RSI): Used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. A trade in a demand zone is considered valid if the RSI indicates an oversold condition.

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): The MACD histogram and signal line are used to identify momentum shifts. A bullish crossover in a demand zone or a bearish crossover in a supply zone provides a strong confirmation signal.

Volume: Volume is a key confirmation tool. A surge in volume upon entering a demand or supply zone indicates strong institutional interest and validates the strength of that zone.

Exponential Moving Average (EMA): The EMA acts as a trend filter. The price's position relative to the EMA helps confirm the overall market trend, preventing trades against a strong prevailing trend.

2. Risk Management
A strict risk management framework was implemented to protect capital. Each trade was entered with a predefined stop-loss and take-profit level based on a 1:3 risk-reward ratio. This means for every dollar at risk, the potential reward is three dollars. This ensures that even with a success rate below 50%, the strategy can still be profitable in the long run.

3. Backtesting and Simulation
To validate the strategy's viability, backtesting was performed using the Backtrader library in Python. Backtrader is a powerful framework that simulates trading on historical data, allowing for the analysis of a strategy's performance without risking real capital.

The backtest was conducted on five years of historical data (from 2019 to 2024) for the following forex pairs:

USD/CAD

EUR/USD

USD/JPY

UER/JPY

XAU/USD (Gold)

The backtesting process allowed for the identification of the strategy's strengths and weaknesses, and provided the necessary data to calculate key performance metrics.
